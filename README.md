# Driver Ranking System (C++)

## Overview
This project implements a **Driver Ranking System** in C++ that processes race performance data, validates inputs, ranks drivers by completion time, and computes time differentials from the leader.

The program emphasizes **robust input handling**, **modular design**, and **clean formatting**, following best practices for introductory and intermediate C++ programming.

## Features
- Parses structured driver data from standard input
- Trims and validates input fields (name, country, time, ranking number)
- Handles invalid and malformed data gracefully
- Ranks drivers by fastest completion time
- Computes and displays time differences from first place
- Outputs clean, formatted rankings
